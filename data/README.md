#### "monthly"" directory\

The source data for the project are 12 .csv files to be located in the "monthly" directory.  They are available from Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lkjpfymd0jfbx1a6ovl8n/monthly_data.zip?rlkey=lprave7iebdst4wvvetz43qa2&dl=0) (209MB zip file).  Nothing additional should be in the "monthly" directory.

#### "yearly" directory\

The R code writes two files containing cleaned data to the "yearly" directory.  It also looks here for one file (geo_calc_vars.csv) generated elsewhere; that file is available from Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/3v2x7ia8t3wbom4gdlny2/h?rlkey=n53l1qck7afmx2eoapsfiszo1&dl=0) (23MB csv file).
