#### "yearly" directory\

The R code writes two files containing cleaned data to the "yearly" directory.  It also looks here for one file (geo_calc_vars.csv) generated elsewhere; that file is available from Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/3v2x7ia8t3wbom4gdlny2/h?rlkey=n53l1qck7afmx2eoapsfiszo1&dl=0)(23MB csv file).
