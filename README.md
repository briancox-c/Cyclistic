Cyclistic Bikeshare Analyisis:<br>Comparing usage between members and non-members
===
<br>

# Purpose

This project is a part of the capstone assignment for the **Google Data Analytics certification.**  It addresses the data cleaning and exploratory portions of the analysis.  An annotated report of these phases is [here](briancox-c/github.io.cyclistic)

The final visualization of the analysis is on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticStory_17111282404990/Cyclistic?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

# Background

Cyclistic is a fictional bikeshare company in Chicago.  A membership is not required to use the service, but some users do have memberships.  The company is conducting a campaign to convert its non-member users into members.  This analysis provides insight for that campaign by comparing how non-members and members use the service.

# Instructions

To run the R script and R markdown after forking and cloning the repo, you will need to download the source data and put it into **~/data/monthly**.

The data, which are open source and available [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), contain multiple years and are organized in monthly files.  *This project uses only the data for the 12 months of **2023***

For convenience, the data specific to this project are available as a single zip file on my Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lkjpfymd0jfbx1a6ovl8n/monthly_data.zip?rlkey=lprave7iebdst4wvvetz43qa2&dl=0).

# Other files

The SQL script, which I wrote and ran in BigQuery, is here for reference and review.  It uses the two files of cleaned data generated by the R script and written to ~/data/yearly.

The R script in this repo also reads in one file (geo_calc_vars.csv) generated in BigQuery.  That file is already included in this repo.  The other tables generated in the SQL script are for use in Tableau.
